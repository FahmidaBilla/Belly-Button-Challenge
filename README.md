# Belly-Button-Challenge

## Details

The aim of this assignment is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard has 3 deliverables.

### Bar Chart

A horizontal bar chart displays the top 10 OTUs found in the selected test subject. The hover text displays the name of the bacteria and the size of the sample collected. 








### Bubble Chart

A bubble chart displays each sample found in the selected test subject. The size of the bubbles correspond to the size of the sample. The hover text displays the name of the bacteria and the sample size.




### Demographic Information

A panel that shows the selected(from the dropdown menu) test subject's demographic information, which appears as follows:
